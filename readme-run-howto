cnn training

    Remove the file "trained_model.h5", run "cnn.py", it will train and save a new model.


cnn prediction

    The prediction will use the newly trained model,
    or load a model from "trained_model.h5",
    or load from "trained_model/saved_model.pb" and "trained_model/variables/".


save model architecture and weights

    Populate the file "trained_model.h5", or the directory "trained_model/",
